# assessment-php
This simple project is meant to test your knowledge in OOP, SOLID Principles, Inheritance, Design patterns, composer, namespacing(PSR-4) etc.
Imagine that you run some kind of car repairs or car maintenance shop and you want to build a cost estimation app for it. This is the current set of services your shop offers:

Your core service is Basic Inspection. For you to do any of the other service(s), Basic Inspection is a pre-requisite, because you need to do that to determine the extent of service before you can perform any of the other services.
Note however that anytime one or more of the other services are requested at once on a single car, there is only one Basic Inspection.
However, a customer can also just request for only Basic Inspection service at your outfit.

1. Basic Inspection ====== Cost $ 50 as (core service);

2. Oil Change ====== Cost $ 85;

3. Tire rotation ====== Cost $23.5;

(Important information for design purposes: With time, you can add new services or remove services apart from your core service):

##TASK LIST

Your app should be able to determine the cost for the following customers dynamically just by at least running the entry file "index.php".

1. Faiq is interested in Basic Inspection;

2. Eshaan is interested in carrying out Oil Change;

3. Aliu is interested in carrying out Tire Rotation;

4. Faiq also enquired about the total cost of performing Oil Change and Tire rotation together on the same car;

## NO UI REQUIRED, YOU CAN USE THE ENTRY FILE TO RUN ON COMMANDLINE TO GET ANSWERS TO DISPLAY THE VARIOUS COST:

##NOTE
###THE FOCUS IS ON THE USE OF OOP AND ITS CONCEPTS, SOLID PRINCIPLES, ANY DESIGN PRINCIPLE, COMPOSER, NAMESPACING ETC.

#### WISH YOU LUCK!
